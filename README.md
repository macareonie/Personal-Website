# Ryan's Personal Site

It's Summer 2024! Unfortunately, I have no proper plans to spend it whatsoever; I'm not going overseas and have no internship opportunities :(

So, what better way to spend it than creating a personal website that I've been putting off for years!

## Content

- About myself
- Food Blog with simple recipes I usually cook and tips I learnt over time
- Current entertainment interests (Games, Shows/Anime, Books/Manga)
- Portfolio (tentative)
- University course reviews (tentative)

## Motivation

Good opportunity to refresh on:

- HTML/CSS
- JavaScript

Good to put into practice and hone:

- Git/GitHub
- SWE principles/standards

Good to learn and experiment with:

- Vite
- TailWindCSS

Ideally, this can become a long sustaining project that would serve as a medium to pen my thoughts and reflect on things as well as a way to stay "fit" with my programming competencies during the long break.
