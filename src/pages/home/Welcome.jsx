          No idea why you are browsing this site but welcome anyways! This small
          summer project is my way of learn web development and new technologies
          and also doubles down as a medium for sharing about myself. Expect all
          kinds of things:
          <ul>
            <li>University course reviews</li>
            <li>Current games and shows I'm following</li>
            <li>Projects I am part of or have completed</li>
            <li>
              A food blog with simple recipes and tips I picked up from my home
              cooking interest
            </li>
          </ul>

          for a friendly conversation or constructive criticism on how to
